== Data Domain Details

The Data Domains described above are implemented using multiple models and other resources. The following subsections describe the Domains' details and link to all their resources.

=== Data Cataloguing Domain

This model is based on the _Data Catalog Vocabulary_ <<DCAT>> and _The Provenance Ontology_ <<PROV>> with extensions to cater for mappings to FAIR <<FAIR>> and CARE <<CARE>> models. The essential model is shown in <<datacataloguing-model, Figure 8>>.

=== Organisations & People Domain

This domain is essentially the organization modelling element of https://schema.org[schema.org] with a few additional properties to track some aspects of organisations relevant to data governance. The essential model is shown in <<org-model, Figure 10>>.

=== Theming Domain

_still to come_

=== Sampling & Observations Domain

This domain is essentially the Data Cube Vocabulary <<DQ>>'s core elements with dataset metadata replaced with elements from DCAT <<DCAT>>. The essential model is shown in <<obs-model, Figure 9>>.

=== Spatiality Domain

The Spatiality domain is the promary concern of the FSDF Project since the project aims to provide an integration mthdology, models and an integrated and estensible "spine" of major national spatial datasets.
