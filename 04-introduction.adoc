== Introduction

This Supermodel is based on previous work from the Location Index project. For clarity, that project is described, followed by how this Supermodel inherits from it.

=== Loc-I Project

The Location Index (LOC-I) project, established in 2018, created a methodology and data models framework providing for a consistent way to seamlessly integrate spatial data from distributed sources. The target was Australian spatial data "of national significance", meaning most - initially all - of the data considered was Australian Federal government data.

See the project website, http://www.ga.gov.au/locationindex, for more project information.

=== Loc-I Technical Implementation 

The technical implementation of Loc-I was based on <<semantic-web-defn, Semantic Web>> principles allowing datasets to be published as <<linked-data-defn, Linked Data>> independently by data holders - different government departments, companies etc. - and consumed with minimal effort required for integration.

The technical implementation relied on a _Loc-I Ontology_, the main Loc-I model, multiple _Background Models_, fundamental, standards, data models that the Loc-I Ontology depended on, and, for some datasets, _Dataset Models_ of their content that spefialise the Loc-I Ontology.

<<#orig-arch, Figure 2>> below shows the original detailed architecture diagram used to explain Loc-I's parts from 2018 - 2021.

=== Loc-I to Supermodel

The FSDF Project has adopted a more rigourously defined _Supermodel_ concept to allow multiple datasets to work together. The ideas are very similar to those used in the Loc-I project however new terminology of a _Backbone Model_, _Component Models_ and the _Supermodel_ has been adopted, as have new forms of model presentation, documentation and so on. The Supermodel concept has been implemented in several other scenarios as well as this one and lessons learned from those implementations have informed this work. 

Additionally, this Supermodel covers more domains than the Loc-I modelling: where Loc-I was restricted to just spatial data, this Supermodel indicated how relate non-spatial data to spatial data. This is important to allow observations - of populations, natural features etc. - to be positioned using FSDF Data Platform objects and allows the creation of data cubes with an FSDF spatial backing.

This Supermodel contains the parts show in <<#models, Figure 3>>.

This Supermodel's integrative, _Backbone Model_, used to integrate objects from the variaous, the dataset-specific, _Component Models_ follows the pattern of use of the 'Loc-I  Ontology' and 'Dataset Model' in the Loc-I project however the _Backbone Model_ now used is just reuse of now standard international models and not a custom model itself. This is possible because international standard models such as GeoSPARSL <<GEO>> now contain elements necissary for project like this that were not incuded when the Loc-I Project started, for example representations of colelctions of geospatial features. This Supermodel's _Observations Models_ are also expressly catered for in the _Backbone Model_ whereas the Loc-I project didn't formalise the integrtion of spatial and observations data.

Some other Loc-I/FSDF Project model differences:

* the Loc-I project specified _Linksets_ to join spatial datasets and this is now done automatically via spatial indexing, rather than static Linkset creation
* Loc-I relied on non-graph-based integrative databases to allow for searching across Loc-I datasets. Wile not part of the Loc-I model _per se_, these elements are show in Loc-I diagrams, suc as <<#orig-arch, Figure 2>>, and documentation. This FSDF Project relies on complete RDF graphs for each dataset included in it and caches the various datasets' graphs into a single graph cache for integration purposes so no non-graph datasets are mentioned in this Supermodel.

=== How to use this Supermodel

This Supermodel provides a general structure for datasets that want to integrate within the FSDF Data Platform. The common tasks you might perform with the Supermodel are:

1. Model a new dataset as an FSDF Supermodel generic dataset
2. Validate new dataset data according to the FSDF Supermodel
3. Create an extended/specialised Component Model for a dataset
4. Validate extended/specialised new dataset data according to the extended/specialised FSDF Supermodel Component Model
5. Create a dataset of observations - population/statistical or natural world - linked to Component Models

Detailed suggestions as to how to achieve these tasks are given below.

==== 1. Model a new dataset

Individual datasets are modelled as <<component-model-defn, Component Models>>. The most basic of Component Models contain `Dataset`, `FeatureCollection` & `Feature` classes modelled using the DCAT & GeoSPARQL Background Models with certain relations. The details of this modelling are given in the first part of the <<Component Models>> section.

To model a highly specialised dataset, you will need to be able to implement both the most basic Component Model elements but also model the specialised elements relevant to your dataset. No specific guidance about your dataset can be given here however the <<Component Models>> section does indicate existing datasets that contain a large amount of specialisation that you may draw inspiration from.

In all cases, you can use the tools listed in the <<Validators>> section to test any data you've created to see if it really is valid according to this Supermodel.

==== 2. Validate new dataset

Data validators are available, for all elements of this Supermodel, so you can use them to validate your data. See the <<Validators>> section.

==== 3. Create an extended/specialised 'Component Model'

As per subsection 1. above, we can't give specific details about specialised modelling here since we don't know about your particular dataset however we can both indicate existing specialised datasets (see the start of the <<Component Models>> section) and we can make a few general points:

* this Supermodel is concerned with the modelling of spatial datasets as Component Models with `Dataset`, `FeatureCollection` & `Feature` with certain relations between them
* most specialisation is likely to occur by adding special properties to `Feature` instances
** for example, the `Feature` instances within the FSDF's https://linked.fsdf.org.au/dataset/electrical-infrastructure/collections/PS[Power Stations] `FeatureCollection` contain properties relevant to power generation, such as `primaryfuelType` indicating coal, biogas etc., and these are important for knowledge of Power Stations but don't affect the general spatial feature modelling of this Supermodel in any way
* spatial relations - between `Feature` instances within one `FeatureCollection` or even across `Dataset` instances - are expected and can be modelled using GeoSPARQL's https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html#_simple_features_relation_family[Simple Features Topological Relations Family].
** No custom modelling is likely required for standard spatial relations
* The geometries of `Feature` instances can be represented in several ways and `Feature` instances can have multiple geometries
** Boundaries at different levels of resolution may be given or geometries with different roles, e.g. high and low tide boundaries

==== 4. Validate extended/specialised new dataset data

As per section 2. above, see the <<Validators>> section. Of course, your specialised modelling won't have a validator for it, however you can certainly ensure that your new data is valid according to this Supermodel.

==== 5. Create a dataset of observations

The spatial datasets within this Supermodel are intended to just present a spatial reference later that observations data can be referenced against. For example, Australian census data is keyed to the Mesh Blocks and other spatial areas of the <<ASGS, ASGS dataset>>, water data in the Bureau of Meteorology's AWRIS system are keyed to catchments within the <<Geofabric, Geofabric dataset>>.

You can create your own observations data and key them to any datasets that exist within this Supermodel or to datasets that you make that are compatible with this Supermodel's elements.

To know how to do this, see <<Annex A: Observations Data>>.
