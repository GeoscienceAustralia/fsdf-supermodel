== Introduction

This Supermodel is based on previous work from the Location Index (Loc-I) Project. For clarity, that the Loc-I Project is described, followed by how this Supermodel inherits from it.

=== Loc-I Project

The Location Index (LOC-I) project, established in 2018, created a methodology, data models and an informal framework to allow for a consistent way to seamlessly integrate spatial data from distributed sources. The target was Australian spatial data "of national significance", meaning most - initially all - of the data considered was Australian Federal government data.

See the project website, http://www.ga.gov.au/locationindex, for more project information.

=== Loc-I Technical Implementation 

The technical implementation of Loc-I was based on <<semantic-web-defn, Semantic Web>> principles allowing datasets to be published as <<linked-data-defn, Linked Data>> independently, by data holders - different government departments, companies etc. - and consumed with minimal effort required for integration.

The technical implementation relied on data from the various datasets sharing common patterns, principally, how the datasets packaged their content and how real-world objects, their spatiality and non-spatial properties were modelled.to this end, a number of <<background-model-defn, Background Models>> were used, to which all Loc-I dataset models - here called <<component-model-defn, Component Models>> - conformed. Additionally, a https://linked.data.gov.au/def/loci[Loc-I Ontology] was also created which both included modelling elements needed for the LocI Project that were not present in Background Models and which was to act as a conceptual, if not technical, conformance target for all Component Models.

<<#orig-arch, Figure 2>> below shows the original detailed architecture diagram used to explain Loc-I's parts from 2018 - 2021.

=== Loc-I to Supermodel

The FSDF Project has adopted a more rigorously defined _Supermodel_ concept to formalise things of importance to Loc-I-like work but which the Loc-I Project didn't define. For example, the categorisation of relevant models as <<background-model-defn, Background Models>>, <<component-model-defn, Component Models>> and so on. The major differences/additions are:

* *Formalised terminology*
** Of general relevance within the implementation scenario
** See the <<Terms & Definitions>> section.
* *Model categorisation*
** For the different types of models within the scenario, for example, <<background-model-defn, Background Models>>, <<component-model-defn, Component Models>>
* *Explicit integration*
** By explicitly defining a <<backbone-model-defn, Backbone Model>> for each scenario deployment, the Supermodel conventions indicate precisely what minimum requirements for <<component-model-defn, Component Models>> are to be able to be integrated
* *Validatable profiling instead of model specialisation*
** Loc-I relied on defining an ontology to which datasets were expected to conform
** Supermodel implements a Profile of Background Models to which Component Datasets mush conform
** The Profile provides executable data validators

In addition to these model/methodological changes, this particular Spuermodel deployment has updated scenario-specific things, in particular:

* *Use of GeoSPARQL 1.1*
** The Loc-I Project motivated extensions to the GeoSPARQL 1.0 ontology which were captured in the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geox[GeoSPARQL Extensions Ontology (GeoX)]. That ontology was then used by many Loc-I Project dataset models (Component Models)
** The update to GeoSPARQL, https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html[GeoSPARQL 1.1], absorbed many of these updates and so there is no longer a need to use GeoX
* *Collection-based Feature organisation*
** Several Loc-I dataset models (Component Models) used specialised properties to indicate aggregations of Feature, e.g. the http://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs[ASGS Ontology's] `aggregatesTo` & `isAggregationOf`
** The latest issue of the ASGS dataset within this Supermodel, online at https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/asgsed3, uses only Collection membership (all Meshblock Features are members of the Meshblocks Feature Collection) and standard topological relations, e.g. each SA2 is `geo:sfWithin` an SA3
** This takes advantage of GeoSPARQL 1.1's collections which match OGC API structures and removes non-standard spatial object relations
** specialised Feature aggregations _may_ be re-added to objects within this Supermodel, if required
* *Topological querying instead of Linksets*
** Loc-I Linksets are datasets that declare topologicla relations between Features
** GeoSPARQL allows topological relationships to be calculated using topologicla functions
** Loc-I Project established only a limited set of Linksets, e.g. the https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/addrmb16-linkset[Current Addresses to 2016 Mesh Blocks Linkset]
** This Supermodel deployment includes a cache of all datasets, https://cache.linked.fsdf.org.au, on which topological queries across all datasets can be performed

To conclude this Loc-I/Supermodel relations, here is a table mapping elements and terminology.

https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geox[GeoX Ontology]
| <<backbone-model-defn, Backbone Model>> | The Backbone Model profiles GeoSPARQL 1.1 and thus incorporates equivalent (updated) GeoX modelling. Loc-I Ontology Linksets are not used. Loc-I Ontology Datasets are replaced with Backbone Model profiling of DCAT

| <<component-model-defn, Component Models>>
| The FSDF Supermodel lists the <<Component Models>> defined to be within it formally in this Supermodel document

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf[GNAF Ontology] | https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html[ANZ National Address Model] | The new model is a more standards-based form of the previous one and all aspects of the original model are covered by the new

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs[ASGS Ontology] | <<Backbone Model>> | The current delivery of the ASGS at https://asgs.linked.fsdf.org.au uses no properties other than those already in the <<Backbone Model>> therefore no custom Component Model is needed

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geofabric[Geofabric Ontology] | unchanged | The Geofabric data online at https://geofabric.linked.fsdf.org.au currently uses only one element of the Geofabric Ontology, the property `hasDownstreamCatchment` however more use of that ontology, or an extended version of it, may be used in the future

| https://linked.data.gov.au/def/placenames[Placenames Ontology] | unchanged | While not an official original Loc-I dataset, Placenames was implemented in Loc-I style at https://fsdf.org.au/dataset/placenames/. It has been brought in to the Supermodel as a standard Component Model using the same ontology, albeit with updates

| Geometry Data Service | https://cache.linked.fsdf.org.au[Graph Cache] | Loc-I build a non-Semantic geometry data service for some cross-dataset spatial queries. Supermodel implements a total cache of all Component Models' content in semantic form for GeoSPARQL spatial querying and other semantic querying
|===

The Loc-I project also implemented a series of custom clients for Loc-I systems. These clients demonstrated

* downloading lists of Loc-I identifiers (IRIs) for classes of object for offline use
* reapportioning numerical observations data formed according to one set of geometries to another
* finding Features that intersect with a given point or Feature

Some of this functionality is now available through the http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/[SPARQL Endpoints] available for all FSDF APIs and also the API accessing a cached copy of all data.

Functionality not covered by SPARQL Endpoints is being implemented in new FSDF clients which Geoscience Australia will release when ready.
