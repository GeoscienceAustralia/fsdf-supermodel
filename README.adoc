= Loc-I Supermodel

WARNING: in early development, not officially released yet

This Model - the Loc-I Supermodel - is the link:http://www.ga.gov.au/locationindex[Location Index (Loc-I) Projects]'s overarching data model that provides integration logic for all Loc-I elements.

This work is part of a project to operationalise Loc-I for https://www.ga.gov.au[Geoscience Australia] by https://surroundaustralia.com[SURROUND Australia Pty Ltd].

[[NOTE]]
====
This work is currently in early development with a complete first release expected in June, 2022.

This work builds on previous work defining overarching mdoels and specialised dataset models for Loc-I datasets developed by https://www.csiro.au[CSIRO] and https://www.ga.gov.au[Geoscience Australia]. All previously developed Loc-I models are incorporated here, albethey with some updates.

== Specification document

This model's document is auto-built from source files within the Loc-I Supermodel repository. Both the document and source files are viewable online.

The Specification document:

* https://surroundaustralia.github.io/loci-supermodel/supermodel.html

The repository:

* https://github.com/surroundaustralia/loci-supermodel

The online and repostory location will certainly change once this model is taken over by Geoscience Australia itself for continued use.
