== Component Models

This section contains the details of the various Component Models used for the individual datasets within the FSDF Data Platform. 

Several datasets in the Platform use only the Backbone Model for their model and thus require no specialised Component Model. It is expected that many straightforward spatial dataset may be able to be created as plain Backbone Model-only datasets in this way if the only contain collections of names Features without special relationships or properties.

The table below lists the current major Datasets in the FSDF Data Platform and their Component Models or use of the Backbone Model.

| Dataset | Persistent Identifier | Model | Notes

| Australian Statistical Geographies Standard, Edition 3 | https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/asgsed3 | <<Backbone Model>> | Previous edisitons of the ASGS dataset used specialised Component Models, in particular the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/asgs[ASGS Ontology], but the current Edition 3 uses only the Backbone Model

| Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric), v3 | https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/geofabric | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/geofabric[Geofabric Ontology] | The Geofabric Ontology is a verm small specailisation of the Backbone Model that only declares specialised classes of `geo:Feature` (`Catchment`, `RiverRegion` etc.), but declares only one special property `hasDownstreamCatchment` for `Catchment` instances

| (Australian) Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) | https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/gnaf | https://w3id.org/profile/anz-address[ANZ National Address Model] | The G-NAF uses a highly specialised Component Model that models many aspects of Addresses

| Placenames | https://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/placenames | https://linked.data.gov.au/def/placenames[Place Names Ontology] | The Place Names ontology originally made for the Loc-I Project is currently used, however a future version might use parts of the https://w3id.org/profile/anz-address[ANZ National Address Model] which covers Place Names also
