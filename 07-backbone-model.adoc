== Backbone Model

The Backbone Model of this Supermodel is the model to which all data _MUST_ conform. The model is a <<profile-defn, profile>> of the Background Models, which means it implements no new modelling elements of its own but just constrains existing elements in the <<Background Models>>. Thus, anything that conforms to the Backbone Model will conform to the Background Models also. This form of profiling is formally defined in _The Profiles Vocabulary_ <<PROF>>.

This Backbone Model is quite "lite" in that it only has comparatively few requirements. This is due to its role: to ensure that all data in the Supermodel exihibts a minimum set of properties and patters for interoperability. the Backbone Model doesn't try to model all thins within all sub-domains of this Supermodel: that is the job of the various <<Component Models>>.
